# A Word on Development
This plugin was originally developed by Mediatricks, but wasn't compatible with BuddyPress.
BuddyPress support was added later by "juliobox", but the plugin still had some problems that prevented it from working well.
This is a repaired, improved version of the "juliobox" version, which was last updated over 5 years ago on WordPress.org.
